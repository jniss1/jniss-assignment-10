# Assignment 10: Image Search

Requirements: Not included in the repository are the coco_images_resized folder and the image_embedding pickle file (these are not included in the repo because they are huge and can be downloaded elsewhere). For the app to work, please place the coco_images_resized folder inside the static folder, and make sure that the image_embedding pickle file is within the main project folder. 

To run the app, just type "make run" in the terminal and follow the link.
